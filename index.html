        In this website, we are going to take your birthday and calculate the

        day of the week you were born and then depending on your gender, we

        will output your Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian
        culture. In this case i took into consideration the Ghanian cultural way of naming their children in which they
        used the day a child was born as their first name, which corresponded to the day in the week when they were
        born.For instance, a Ghanian girl born on Sunday was named Akosua and a boy born on the same day was given the
        name Kwasi.

    <p id="p2">Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such Ivory Coast and
      Ghana. A child's name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth
      or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.</p>
