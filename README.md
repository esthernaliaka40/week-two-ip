Description Of Project
The project is all about Ghanian traditional way of naming their children using the day the baby was born as his/her fist name, Version Date :6th October 2022

This is a project about building a web application that took  a user's birthday and calculated the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.  In this case i took into consideration the Ghanian cultural way of naming their children in which they used the day a child was born as their first name, which corresponded to the day in the week when they were born.For instance, a Ghanian girl born on Sunday was named Akosua and a boy born on the same day was given the name Kwasi.
