# Project name.

Esther's Akan Name Website

## Project description.

This is a project about building a web application that took a user's birthday and calculated the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. In this case i took into consideration the Ghanian cultural way of naming their children in which they used the day a child was born as their first name, which corresponded to the day in the week when they were born.For instance, a Ghanian girl born on Sunday was named Akosua and a boy born on the same day was given the name Kwasi.
